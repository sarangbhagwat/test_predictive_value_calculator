# test_predictive_value_calculator
Tools to characterize the implications of medical tests for use in a personal, non-advisory capacity. Given a test's false positive rate (1 - specificity) and false negative rate (1 - sensitivity) as well as the prevalence of the condition that the test attempted to identify, estimates the positive predictive value (probability of having the condition given that the test result was positive) and negative predictive value (probability of having the condition given that the test result was negative). Ignores other factors (e.g. human error, exposure after the test, etc.). Useful default values and plots are provided.
